# Simple Shell, Checks

This repository is a companion to the simple_shell. It contains all kind of checks we thought could be useful to test our simple shell programs. It is a fork from an [example](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x15.c) we were given on how to check our shell. We added on it keeping the same format.

## Configuration

Open the file `config` and update the variable `SHELL` with your shell.

## Run

Usage `./check_simple_shell.bash`
